How things are done?

Everything has a:
-----------------

Baconian Method
Postmodernism

Isnt it remarkable that humnds organize themselves accorgind to how
they...

Narcissism of small differences
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously

Ruby influences
---------------

* [] Array syntax - C
* {:a => 1} Hash syntax = php
* {a: 1} Hash syntax - javascript
* string mehtods - perl
* begin...rescue..ensure / loopp, redo, retry - eiffel
* postconditionals - cache, jqss, algol

Piraha language - Daniel Leonard Everett
----------------------------------------

- tiny phonetic inventory
- whistled to communcate in jingle
- no relative claouses or grmmatical recursion
- no condinal or ordinal
- no unique words for color
- epistemology as grammatical constuct

6000 natural languages - hundreds dying every year

English as universal programming language

We a re a procduct of our culture... but we are not beholden to it.

- stay curius
- look around
- retrospect
